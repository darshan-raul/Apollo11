# Apollo11 — Agent Context

## What This Project Is

Apollo11 is a **13-phase Kubernetes/cloud-native learning bootstrap** using **Apollo Airlines** — a flight management system — as the teaching application. Each stage is hands-on: you build real services, deploy them to a real cluster, and add operational concerns (networking, storage, monitoring, security, scaling) stage by stage.

**Target learner:** someone with basic Linux knowledge, no prior k8s or cloud-native experience required.

## Stage Map

| Phase | Name | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| Launchpad | Docker Compose | 10 components, stub code, local dev |
| Ignition | kind cluster | First pod, kubectl basics, cluster architecture |
| Stage 1 | Liftoff | All 10 components as Deployments, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Jobs (single-namespace baseline) |
| Stage 2 | Guidance/N&C | **5 manifest sets** — Namespaces, DNS, ServiceAccounts, Headless Services, NetworkPolicies (reference), Ingress (Traefik), Ingress+dashboard, LoadBalancer+MetalLB, Gateway API (Envoy)+MetalLB. Each set introduces one new concept on top of the previous. |
| Stage 3 | Mission Data | StatefulSets + 1Gi PVCs for all 4 stateful workloads (3 PG + redis), schema bootstrap via Postgres `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` ConfigMap mount, idempotent seed Jobs. **Envoy Gateway + MetalLB access stack from Stage 2 set 4 carries over verbatim and persists for all later stages.** |
| Stage 4 | Flight Control | Probes, resource limits, QoS, PodDisruptionBudget |
| Stage 5 | Payload Integration | Helm chart (full access stack), Kustomize overlays (dev/staging/prod), GitHub Actions CI, **ArgoCD GitOps module** (AppProject + 3 Applications) |
| Stage 6 | Mission Ops | Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry |
| Stage 7 | Orbital Maneuvering | HPA, VPA, Redis cache, taints/tolerations, affinity |
| Stage 8 | Command Module | RBAC, SecurityContext, OPA, Vault |
| Stage EKS | Cloud Target — EKS | Stage 2 set 5 + Stage 3 workloads on real AWS: EKS cluster (terraform-aws-modules/eks v21.x), AWS NLB via AWS Load Balancer Controller, EBS CSI driver + ebs-gp3 StorageClass (WaitForFirstConsumer), ECR per service. One-command spin-up/teardown. The Stage 2 set 5 manifests are reused verbatim; the only changes are 5 LBC annotations on the `EnvoyProxy` + the `ebs-gp3` StorageClass. |
| Stage 9 | Lunar Orbit | EKS/GKE via Terraform, Cluster Autoscaler, HA |
| Stage 10 | Mission Extensions | Linkerd, Argo Rollouts, Chaos Mesh, DevSecOps |
| Stage 11 | Towards Mars | CRDs/Operators, k3s homelab, KEDA |

```

**Key design principle:** Each stage's `code/` is a self-contained snapshot. Stage N+1 copies Stage N's code and adds its additions. This keeps every stage independently runnable.

---

## Apollo11 vs Apollo11-Docs (Two-Repo Pattern)

**Apollo11** (`/home/darshan/projects/Apollo11/`) — the **code repository**
- All service code, Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, scripts, and stage READMEs live here.
- This is the repo users clone to follow along and run the labs.
- Never modify Apollo11 code based on what's in the docs — the code is the source of truth.

**Apollo11-Docs** (`/home/darshan/projects/apollo11-docs/`) — the **Docusaurus learning site**
- Built with Docusaurus, deployed separately (e.g., Vercel).
- Contains narrative guides, screenshots, step-by-step instructions, architecture diagrams, and explanations.
- Docs reference Apollo11 code by path — the docs don't contain the code itself.
- When updating docs, write detailed instructional content (screenshots, commands, troubleshooting, expected outputs) — don't just summarize. The docs teach; Apollo11 is the lab environment.

**Relationship:** Apollo11 is the lab, apollo11-docs is the textbook. They are separate repos. Apollo11 code changes don't require docs updates (except when behavior changes), but every new topic covered in docs should have corresponding working code in Apollo11.

## Stage Details

### Launchpad

**Location:** `stages/launchpad/`

**Components:** 10 total (6 app services + 4 infra)

**Code requirements per service:**
- `/healthz` — liveness probe (returns 200 if process alive)
- `/readyz` — readiness probe (returns 200 only when DB connections + downstream reachability are healthy, 503 otherwise)
- `/metrics` — Prometheus-compatible (`http_requests_total`, `http_request_duration_ms`, `db_connections_active` for stateful services)
- Structured JSON logging: `{"timestamp","level","service","trace_id","span_id","message",...}`
- `X-Request-ID` header propagation (generate if not present, forward on all downstream calls)
- **CORS middleware** on all services (Go and Python) — `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, all methods/headers, 204 for OPTIONS
- **DB connection: always append `?sslmode=disable`** — Go `lib/pq` driver defaults to SSL; PostgreSQL containers in dev have no SSL
- **Graceful `initDB()` with timeout** — use `context.WithTimeout` + `PingContext`; never use infinite retry loops; log errors during retry
- Stub implementations — return hardcoded but valid-appearing JSON

**Seed data (present from first `docker compose up`):**
- 6 airports: BOM, DEL, SIN, DXB, LHR, JFK
- 6 flights: AA101, AA102, AA201, AA202, AA301, AA401 (today + 30 days)
- 2 users: admin@apolloairlines.com/admin123 (ADMIN), passenger@apolloairlines.com/pass123 (PASSENGER)

**Infrastructure init:** PostgreSQL init scripts via `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` pattern.

---

### Stage 1 (Liftoff)

**Location:** `stages/stage1/`

**k8s manifests (27 files):**
- `namespace.yaml` — `apollo-airlines` namespace
- `configmap.yaml` — service ports, internal URLs, database names
- `secrets.yaml` — POSTGRES_PASSWORD, JWT_SECRET
- 4 infra Deployments + Services (identity-db, flight-db, booking-db, redis)
- 3 Init Jobs (identity-db, flight-db, booking-db) + Init ConfigMaps
- 6 app Deployments + Services (identity, flight, booking, search, notification, frontend)
- `kustomization.yaml` — top-level resource list
- `scripts/build-images.sh` — builds + loads images into kind

**Stage 1 code changes vs launchpad:** None (k8s deployment layer only)

---

### Stage 2 (Guidance/N&C)

**Location:** `stages/stage2/`

**Architecture:** Same 10 workloads, **5 self-contained manifest sets** that teach different edge access patterns. Each set introduces **one new concept** on top of the previous. Workloads never change between sets — only the "edge" object does.

| Set | Concept | Access | Verify |
|---|---|---|---|
| `set1-baseline` | `Service type: NodePort` (no controller) | `localhost:30080–30084` | 25/25 pass |
| `set2-ingress` | Traefik v3 Ingress + `Host:`-based routing | `*.apollo.local:30443` | 26/26 pass |
| `set3-traefik-dashboard` | Traefik dashboard via `IngressRoute` → `api@internal` | `traefik.apollo.local:30443` | 27/27 pass |
| `set4-metallb-traefik` | `Service type: LoadBalancer` + MetalLB L2 (real IP, no NodePort) | `*.apollo.local` on MetalLB IP | 26/26 pass |
| `set5-envoy-gateway` | Envoy Gateway API (GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute, ReferenceGrant, EnvoyProxy) on MetalLB | `*.apollo.local` on MetalLB IP | 29/29 pass |

**Namespaces (2, not 3):**
- `apollo-airlines-apps` — identity, flight, booking, search, notification, identity-db, flight-db, booking-db, redis, init jobs
- `apollo-airlines-ui` — frontend

(Original plan had 3 namespaces with infra split out. Collapsed to 2 to avoid
init-job-namespace-mismatch bugs and keep DB hostnames short
e.g. `identity-db` instead of `identity-db.apollo-airlines-infra.svc.cluster.local`.)

**Per-set layout (each set is self-contained, ~30–50 files):**
```

```

**Hostnames (sets 2–5):** `frontend.apollo.local`, `identity.apollo.local`,
`flight.apollo.local`, `booking.apollo.local`, `search.apollo.local`
(set 3 also has `traefik.apollo.local`).

**Headless Services:** `identity-db-headless`, `flight-db-headless`,
`booking-db-headless`, `redis-headless` (`clusterIP: None`) — wired to
StatefulSets in Stage 3.

**ServiceAccounts:** 13 SAs (identity, flight, booking, search, notification,
frontend, identity-db, flight-db, booking-db, redis + 3 init job SAs). No
`Role`/`RoleBinding` yet — those arrive in Stage 8.

**NetworkPolicies:** Manifests provided for reference
(default-deny + per-service allowlist). **NOT applied by `apply.sh`** because
kind's default `kindnet` CNI does not enforce NetworkPolicies. The
educational value is in reading them, not in enforcement.

**Traefik v3.1 IngressController (sets 2, 3, 4):** DaemonSet on control-plane,
listens on NodePort 30443. Host header routing across 5 Ingresses. Set 3
adds the Traefik dashboard via an `IngressRoute` (Traefik CRD) pointing at
the controller's built-in `api@internal` service. Requires the controller
to be started with `--configFile=/etc/traefik/traefik.toml` (static config
that explicitly enables the API + dashboard).

**Envoy Gateway v1.5.0 (set 5):**
- `install.yaml` (~2.9MB) bundled in-repo (offline-friendly) — must use
  `kubectl apply --server-side` (exceeds 256KB last-applied-config limit otherwise)
- `install.yaml` does **NOT** create a `GatewayClass` — create it manually:
  `controllerName: gateway.envoyproxy.io/gatewayclass-controller`
- Auto-created Envoy Service is `type: LoadBalancer` by default — MetalLB
  assigns a real IP, no port-forward needed
- The `EnvoyProxy` resource (`spec.provider.kubernetes.envoyService.type:
  LoadBalancer`) is what wires the Gateway to the auto-created Service
- Cross-namespace HTTPRoute attachments need `parentRef.namespace` +
  `ReferenceGrant` in target namespace
- 6 HTTPRoutes + 1 ReferenceGrant (frontend in `ui` ns → Gateway in `apps` ns)

**MetalLB v0.14.5 native (sets 4, 5):**
- L2 mode (ARP/NDP) — no router config required
- `metallb-native.yaml` (~1900 lines) bundled in-repo — use
  `kubectl apply --server-side --force-conflicts` (webhook manages its own CA)
- IP pool: `172.18.0.50–100` on default kind docker network (must not
  overlap with kind node IPs)
- Wait for webhook controller pod to be `1/1` before creating IPAddressPool

**Envoy Gateway version-sweep (set 5):** All 5 versions tested
(v1.2.4, v1.3.0, v1.4.0, v1.4.5, v1.5.0) correctly materialize the
data-plane listener via LDS and serve HTTP 200. **Chose v1.5.0** for set
5 — see `stages/stage2/NOTES.md` for the test methodology. Newer versions
(v1.6, v1.7, v1.8) also pass; v1.5 minimizes risk of new surprises while
matching the version we already validated.

**Service type rules across sets:**
- Set 1: `type: NodePort + nodePort: 30xxx`
- Sets 2/3: `type: ClusterIP` (NodePort removed)
- Set 4: `type: LoadBalancer` (MetalLB gives it a real IP)
- Set 5: `type: LoadBalancer` (EnvoyProxy + MetalLB)

**Frontend image:** VITE\_\* API URLs are baked at build time. Each set
rebuilds the frontend image with its own URL pattern. The shared
`stages/stage2/code/frontend/vite.config.js` uses `process.env.VITE_*`
(or a sane localhost default) so build args take effect. `apply.sh` handles
both build and kind load.

**Stage 2 code changes vs stage1:** None (networking layer only — `stages/stage2/code/` is a snapshot of `stages/stage1/code/`).

**Lessons learned in this restage:**
- The 4-set → 5-set restage happened because the Envoy Gateway set
  (originally `set3-gateway-nodeport`) was using a broken Envoy
  Gateway v1.2.4 that needed a `kubectl patch` loop to override the
  auto-created `ClusterIP` Service. Splitting "introduce LoadBalancer
  IP via MetalLB" (set 4) from "introduce Gateway API" (set 5) gives
  each set a single new concept.
- The 4 manifest sets that were deleted (`set3-gateway-nodeport/`,
  `set4-metallb-gateway/`) are not in git history anymore; if you
  need to revisit the original design, see the v1.2.4 install.yaml
  in the commit history.

---

### Stage 3 (Mission Data)

**Location:** `stages/stage3/`

**Architecture:** Same 10 workloads + same Envoy Gateway + MetalLB access stack as Stage 2 **set 5** (the restaged layout). The 4 stateful workloads (`identity-db`, `flight-db`, `booking-db`, `redis`) move from `Deployment` + `emptyDir` to `StatefulSet` + `1Gi PVC`. App Deployments, frontend, gateway, MetalLB, ServiceAccounts, NetworkPolicies are **unchanged**. The Stage 2 set-5 access stack is the **persisted baseline for all later stages** (4–11).

| Group | Files | What |
|---|---|---|
| `k8s/config/` | 3 | Namespaces, ConfigMap, Secret (verbatim from set 4) |
| `k8s/serviceaccounts/` | 1 | 13 SAs (verbatim from set 4) |
| `k8s/networkpolicies/` | 16 | Reference only (verbatim from set 4) |
| `k8s/apps/identity-db/` | 4 | `*-sts.yaml` (StatefulSet + 1Gi VCT + init SQL mounted at `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`), `*-svc.yaml` (ClusterIP), `*-svc-headless.yaml`, `*-init-script.yaml` (ConfigMap) |
| `k8s/apps/flight-db/` | 4 | same shape (UNIQUE on `(flight_number, departure_time)` so the same flight can fly daily) |
| `k8s/apps/booking-db/` | 4 | same shape |
| `k8s/apps/redis/` | 3 | `redis-sts.yaml` (with AOF enabled), `redis-svc.yaml`, `redis-svc-headless.yaml` |
| `k8s/apps/{identity,flight,booking,search,notification,frontend}/` | 12 | Unchanged Deployment + Service |
| `k8s/jobs/` | 6 | 3 × `seed-*.yaml` Jobs + 3 × `*-db-seed` ConfigMaps (idempotent `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`) |
| `k8s/gateway/` | 10 | Verbatim from Stage 2 set 5 (Envoy Gateway v1.5.0 install + GatewayClass + Gateway + 6 HTTPRoutes + ReferenceGrant) |
| `k8s/metallb/` | 2 | Verbatim from Stage 2 set 5 (install + IPAddressPool + L2Advertisement) |
| `scripts/` | 4 | `apply.sh` (preflight + 10 numbered steps, waits for StatefulSets before jobs), `teardown.sh` (deletes namespaces + Gateway + controllers, ordered to avoid webhook hangs), `verify.sh` (53 checks), `build-images.sh` |

**Storage:** `storageClassName` is **intentionally omitted** from `volumeClaimTemplates` — uses kind's default `local-path` StorageClass. PVCs are `ReadWriteOnce, 1Gi`. PVs are node-local on the kind worker. Reclaim policy is `Delete` (default), so deleting the PVC reclaims the local-path volume.

**Schema bootstrap (entrypoint hook, not init container):** The schema (CREATE TABLE) is mounted as a ConfigMap at `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql` inside the Postgres container, with `PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata`. The official Postgres image's entrypoint runs the SQL during `initdb` on first start (empty PVC). On every subsequent restart, the data dir is non-empty and the entrypoint skips both `initdb` and `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`. **Why not a custom init container:** that approach deadlocks — the init's `pg_isready` against `127.0.0.1` waits for the main container, but the kubelet gates the main container on init's success. The entrypoint hook is the standard Postgres pattern and doesn't have this issue.

**Seed jobs:** 3 one-shot Jobs (`seed-identity-db`, `seed-flight-db`, `seed-booking-db`) that insert seed data using `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. The `seed-booking-db` Job is intentionally near-empty (booking has no seed data) but kept to prove the schema-applied and to keep the pattern uniform.

**Stable pod identity:** The StatefulSet `serviceName` is wired to the existing headless services (`identity-db-headless`, `flight-db-headless`, `booking-db-headless`, `redis-headless`). Pods get FQDNs like `identity-db-0.apollo-airlines-apps.svc.cluster.local` for direct pod-to-pod addressing (used by the StatefulSet controller, not by app code).

**Why entrypoint hook vs Job for schema:** The entrypoint runs the SQL once on first start of the pod (when the data dir is empty). A Job runs once per cluster creation — if the StatefulSet pod moves to a fresh node with an empty PVC, the entrypoint re-applies the schema (idempotently). Seed stays as a Job because re-inserting 186 flight rows on every restart is wasteful (even with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`).

**Code changes vs stage2:** None. `stages/stage3/code/` is a snapshot of `stages/stage2/code/`. App code doesn't know whether the DB is behind a Deployment or StatefulSet.

**Critical (from the b968cb9 review pass — read before changing the frontend):**
- `stages/stage3/code/frontend/vite.config.js` must read `VITE_*` from
  `process.env` (synced from Stage 2's fix). The old `define` block
  with hardcoded `:8080` URLs would have made the frontend ignore
  the Dockerfile's `--build-arg VITE_IDENTITY_URL=...`.
- `stages/stage3/code/frontend/nginx.conf` (new) defines the three
  probe endpoints (`/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/healthz/{startup,live,ready}`)
  that the frontend Deployment's liveness + readiness probes point at.
  The old Dockerfile's inline `RUN echo > default.conf` had no
  probe endpoints, which would have made the frontend pod's
  readiness probe fail continuously and the Service would have
  no endpoints.
- `stages/stage3/code/frontend/Dockerfile` uses `COPY nginx.conf`
  instead of the inline `RUN echo` pattern.

### Stage 4 (Flight Control)

**Location:** `stages/stage4/`

**Status:** ✅ Complete. 129/129 verify checks pass on a fresh kind cluster (76 Stage 3 baseline + 53 new Stage 4 checks).

**Architecture:** Same 10 workloads as Stage 3 + same Envoy Gateway + MetalLB access stack. This stage adds **probes** (so the kubelet can detect unhealthy pods), **resource governance** with Guaranteed QoS (so the scheduler can place pods predictably and OOM events are bounded), **PodDisruptionBudgets** (so voluntary disruptions can't take down the UI or the flagship booking service), and **graceful SIGTERM shutdown** (so in-flight requests drain cleanly instead of dropping). The Stage 2 set-4 access stack (Envoy + MetalLB) is unchanged.

| Group | Files | What |
|---|---|---|
| `k8s/config/` | 3 | Verbatim from stage 3 |
| `k8s/serviceaccounts/` | 1 | 13 SAs (verbatim from stage 3) |
| `k8s/networkpolicies/` | 16 | Reference only (verbatim from stage 3) |
| `k8s/apps/{identity,flight,booking,search,notification,frontend}/` | 12 | Add `startupProbe` + `livenessProbe` + `readinessProbe` (all 3 HTTP, distinct paths), `resources.requests == resources.limits` (Guaranteed QoS), `terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30` |
| `k8s/apps/{identity-db,flight-db,booking-db,redis}/` | 7 | Add `resources.requests == resources.limits` + `terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60`. **No new probes** — liveness + readiness already in stage 3. **No `startupProbe`** — Postgres' `initdb` / Redis init is the implicit start. |
| `k8s/pdb/` (new) | 2 | `booking-pdb.yaml` (apps ns), `frontend-pdb.yaml` (ui ns) — both `minAvailable: 1` |
| `k8s/jobs/` | 6 | Verbatim from stage 3 |
| `k8s/gateway/` | 10 | Verbatim from stage 3 |
| `k8s/metallb/` | 2 | Verbatim from stage 3 |
| `scripts/` | 4 | `apply.sh` (10 steps, applies `k8s/pdb/` after apps), `teardown.sh` (verbatim from stage 3), `verify.sh` (129 checks), `build-images.sh` (verbatim from stage 3) |

**Probe paths (split into 3 distinct endpoints):**

| Path | Returns | k8s probe | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/healthz/startup` | 200 once HTTP server is up | `startupProbe` | Gives the container 30s to bootstrap before liveness takes over (initialDelay 0, period 5s, failureThreshold 6) |
| `/healthz/live` | 200 unconditionally | `livenessProbe` | "Process is alive" — restart on failure (initialDelay 15, period 10s, failureThreshold 3) |
| `/healthz/ready` | 200 if DB/Redis reachable, 503 otherwise | `readinessProbe` | "Can handle traffic" — pull from Service endpoints on failure (initialDelay 5, period 5s, failureThreshold 3) |
| `/healthz` | 200 | — | Legacy back-compat (smoke tests, external monitoring) |
| `/readyz` | 200 | — | Legacy back-compat alias of /healthz/ready |

**Why split them:** with a single endpoint, a temporary DB blip
would trigger a liveness restart — a self-inflicted outage.
Conflating "is the process alive?" with "is the process able to
serve right now?" is one of the most common k8s configuration bugs.

**Resource tiers (Guaranteed QoS — `requests == limits`):**

| Tier | Workloads | CPU | Memory |
|---|---|---|---|
| App default | identity, flight, search | 100m | 128Mi |
| Flagship | booking | 200m | 256Mi |
| Low traffic | notification | 50m | 64Mi |
| Edge | frontend (NGINX) | 50m | 64Mi |
| Postgres | identity-db, flight-db, booking-db | 200m | 256Mi |
| Redis | redis | 100m | 128Mi |

`requests == limits` is the **definition** of Guaranteed QoS.
Burstable is a deliberate Stage 7+ concern when we have variable
load (HPA, VPA). Stage 4 is the right time to *teach* Guaranteed
because students can reason about it deterministically.

**`terminationGracePeriodSeconds`:**

| Workload | Grace | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 6 app Deployments | 30s | Matches the `srv.Shutdown(30s)` budget in Go / `timeout_graceful_shutdown=30` in uvicorn |
| 4 StatefulSets (PG, redis) | 60s | Postgres checkpoint + WAL flush, Redis AOF rewrite can spike |

**PodDisruptionBudgets:**

| PDB | ns | minAvailable | Replicas | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `booking-pdb` | apollo-airlines-apps | 1 | 2 | A node drain cannot take booking below 1 ready pod |
| `frontend-pdb` | apollo-airlines-ui | 1 | 2 | A node drain cannot take the UI offline |

PDBs only apply to **voluntary** disruptions (the eviction API).
Node hardware failure and OOMKill ignore PDBs and are handled by
replica count + re-creation.

**Graceful shutdown code patterns:**

*Go services (flight, booking, search, notification):*
```go
srv := &http.Server{Addr: ":" + port, Handler: r}
go srv.ListenAndServe()                      // non-blocking
quit := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
signal.Notify(quit, syscall.SIGTERM, syscall.SIGINT)
<-quit
logJSON("INFO", svc, "Received SIGTERM, shutting down gracefully", ...)
srv.Shutdown(ctx)                            // drain in-flight, 30s budget
db.Close()                                   // release connection pool
```
`srv.Shutdown(ctx)` is the Go stdlib primitive: it stops accepting
new connections, waits for in-flight requests to complete, and
returns. If `ctx` expires first, `Shutdown` returns
`context.DeadlineExceeded` and the kubelet SIGKILLs us.

*Python/identity:*
```python
def _log_sigterm(signum, frame):
    log_json("INFO", "identity-service", "Received SIGTERM, ...")
signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, _log_sigterm)
uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8080,
             timeout_graceful_shutdown=30, access_log=False)
```
uvicorn's default SIGTERM handler sets `should_exit=True`, triggering
a graceful drain via `Server.shutdown()`. Our handler runs *first*
(just logs), then uvicorn's runs and drains. The `lifespan` context
manager handles DB cleanup.

*Frontend (NGINX):* receives SIGTERM, exits within ~1s. No app-level
drain needed.

**Code changes vs stage3:**

- All 4 Go services (flight, booking, search, notification) + 2-stage
  Python (identity): add 3 new probe handlers + `http.Server.Shutdown`
  graceful drain
- `code/identity/main.py`: add `import signal` + register a prior
  SIGTERM handler that logs; uvicorn's handler does the actual drain.
  Add `timeout_graceful_shutdown=30` to `uvicorn.run()`
- `code/frontend/nginx.conf` (new file): three `location = /healthz/*`
  blocks returning 200 unconditionally
- `code/frontend/Dockerfile`: `COPY nginx.conf` instead of inline
  `echo > default.conf`
- All Dockerfiles for backend services: **no changes** (binary
  entrypoint is the same)
- `stages/stage4/code/` is a snapshot of `stages/stage3/code/` with
  the above edits

**Verify target:** 129 checks (76 Stage 3 baseline + 53 new):
- 18: probes configured on 6 app Deployments (3 probes × 6 deps)
- 12: probes on 4 sts (liveness + readiness each, NO startupProbe)
- 10: resources.requests/limits on all 10 workloads
- 10: QoS class is Guaranteed on all 10 pods
- 10: terminationGracePeriodSeconds (30 for apps, 60 for sts)
- 4: PDBs exist + status populated
- 18: live probe responses — `kubectl exec ... wget /healthz/{startup,live,ready}` × 6 apps
- 4: behavioural demo (delete booking pod → "Received SIGTERM" in
  logs + replacement Ready; delete frontend pod → replacement
  serves /healthz/ready)

**Lessons from this stage (read before changing):**

1. **`kubectl logs <old-pod> --previous` returns NotFound once the
   pod is removed from the API server.** The graceful-shutdown
   verify uses `kubectl logs --follow` in a background process
   *before* the delete, then greps the captured output. See
   `stages/stage4/scripts/verify.sh` line ~417.

2. **uvicorn's default SIGTERM handler is the right one — don't
   replace it.** `sys.exit(0)` on SIGTERM drops in-flight requests.
   Register a *prior* handler that just logs and let uvicorn do
   the drain.

3. **DB StatefulSets don't need a `startupProbe`.** Postgres' own
   `initdb` blocks the main process from accepting connections,
   so `pg_isready` is an implicit startup check. A `startupProbe`
   would race with the entrypoint.

4. **NGINX reports Ready before it serves HTTP in some cases.**
   The frontend verify retries 30× and re-fetches the pod name
   each iteration (the API server returns the old deleting pod
   for 1-2s after `kubectl delete --wait=false`).

5. **The teardown script from Stage 3 handles the
   Gateway/MetalLB ordering correctly. Reused verbatim.** The
   teardown order is: app namespaces → Gateway + HTTPRoutes →
   Envoy (with `timeout 60` + `--force --grace-period=0`
   fallback) → MetalLB.

6. **The frontend's probe paths return 200 unconditionally.**
   NGINX has no local DB/Redis to check. Readiness on the
   frontend is "process is alive and serving", which a successful
   HTTP response already proves.

### Stage 5 (Payload Integration)

**Location:** `stages/stage5/`

**Status:** ✅ Complete. Helm chart (`helm/apollo11/`) provisions the full cluster from a single `helm install` — 2 namespaces, 13 SAs, 3 PG + 1 Redis StatefulSets, 6+1 Deployments, 2 PDBs, 3 seed Jobs, Envoy Gateway + 6 HTTPRoutes + 1 ReferenceGrant, MetalLB IPAddressPool. Kustomize overlays (`overlays/{base,dev,staging,prod}/`) provide a plain-manifest alternative for dev-friendly iteration. GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) lints, builds, and pushes images to GHCR. **ArgoCD GitOps module** (`argocd/`) is the declarative delivery layer — AppProject + 3 Applications (dev auto-sync, staging auto-sync, prod manual-sync pinned to `v1.0.0`).

**k8s manifest changes:** None at the workload level (Stage 5 is a packaging layer). The chart's `templates/` produce the same Deployments/StatefulSets/Services that Stage 4's `k8s/` tree contains.

**New files:**
- `helm/apollo11/Chart.yaml` + `values.yaml` — chart metadata + configurable defaults
- `helm/apollo11/bundles/envoy-gateway-install.yaml` — v1.2.4 (~2.4MB, offline-friendly)
- `helm/apollo11/bundles/metallb-native.yaml` — v0.14.5 (~67KB, offline-friendly)
- `helm/apollo11/templates/` — 27 templates (config, infra, apps, ui, pdb, jobs, gateway)
- `overlays/base/` — plain manifest base (6 apps + frontend)
- `overlays/{dev,staging,prod}/` — environment overlays (replicas, image tags, PDBs in prod only)
- `scripts/apply.sh` — mode-aware: `--mode helm|kustomize` + `--env dev|staging|prod`
- `scripts/teardown.sh` — symmetric teardown + `--purge` for namespace cleanup
- `scripts/verify.sh` — ~70 checks (namespaces, SAs, ConfigMap, Secret, StatefulSets, Deployments, probes, resources, PDBs, seed jobs, Gateway, HTTPRoutes, MetalLB)
- `scripts/build-images.sh` — 6 services + frontend with VITE_* URLs from `values.yaml`
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` — replaces stub. Lint + matrix build + GHCR push (no deploy)
- `argocd/install.sh` — ArgoCD v2.13.2 install (online by default, `--fetch-bundle` for air-gap)
- `argocd/uninstall.sh` — symmetric teardown of the ArgoCD system
- `argocd/projects/project.yaml` — `AppProject` restricting to 2 namespaces, no cluster-scoped
- `argocd/applications/{dev,staging,prod}.yaml` — 3 Applications, one per env, all sourcing the Stage 5 chart
- `argocd/scripts/bootstrap.sh` — idempotent registration of project + 3 apps, `--sync` to force-sync
- `argocd/scripts/verify.sh` — ~25 GitOps checks (system pods, AppProject, Applications, workloads, drift)
- `argocd/scripts/teardown.sh` — apps-only / `--full` / `--purge` levels
- `argocd/DEMO.md` — 101 walkthrough (install, bootstrap, sync, drift demo, rollback, teardown)
- `argocd/ARGOCD.md` — complete ArgoCD reference guide (reconciliation model, architecture, AppProject/Application/ApplicationSet, source types, sync policies, hooks/waves/windows, RBAC, multi-cluster, HA, anti-patterns)

**ArgoCD Application sync policies (per env):**

| Application | Sync | Prune | SelfHeal | Image tag | PDBs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| apollo11-dev     | automated | true  | true  | `:dev`     | off |
| apollo11-staging | automated | true  | true  | `:latest`  | off |
| apollo11-prod    | **manual** | false (in options) | false | `:v1.0.0` pinned | on |

Dev and staging auto-converge on git push; prod is human-gated. The `targetRevision` on prod is pinned to the `v1.0.0` tag (bump the file to roll forward).

**Code changes vs stage4:** None (snapshot of `stages/stage4/code/`).

---

### Stage 6 (Mission Ops)

**Location:** `stages/stage6/`

**Status:** ✅ Complete (all manifests rendered + Go services compile-validated; full end-to-end test on a fresh kind cluster was not run — no kind cluster was available in the build environment). Helm chart renders 172 resources. All 4 Go services build successfully with the new OTEL SDK + Prometheus client_golang deps.

**k8s manifest changes:**
- **Prometheus** (Deployment, 5Gi PVC) — config + 16 alert rules in 4 groups (services, latency, errors, infrastructure)
- **Grafana** (Deployment, 1Gi PVC) — 5 dashboards as ConfigMaps, 3 datasources (Prometheus, Loki, Tempo)
- **OTEL Collector** (DaemonSet) — OTLP gRPC receiver on :4317, exports to Tempo
- **Tempo** (Deployment, 5Gi PVC) — single-binary trace backend, 48h retention
- **Loki** (Deployment, 5Gi PVC) + **Promtail** (DaemonSet) — log aggregation, 7d retention
- **5 ServiceMonitors** (one per backend) — Prometheus auto-discovers /metrics endpoints
- **Grafana HTTPRoute** + **ReferenceGrant** — exposed at `grafana.apollo.local` via existing Envoy Gateway
- **New namespace** `apollo-observability` with 1 SA + ClusterRole binding (read-only across all namespaces for ServiceMonitor discovery)

**Code changes vs stage5:**
- **All 4 Go services** (booking, flight, search, notification): +OTEL SDK init (otlptracegrpc, otlpmetricgrpc), otelgin middleware, promhttp /metrics handler with real `http_requests_total` + `http_request_duration_ms` counters, logJSON pulls trace_id/span_id from active OTEL span context, outbound HTTP clients inject W3C `traceparent` header
- **Identity (Python)**: +OTEL SDK init, FastAPIInstrumentor, Psycopg2Instrumentor, requests instrumentation, prometheus_client /metrics with real exposition format
- **All 5 backend Dockerfiles**: unchanged (new deps picked up via `go mod download` / `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- **Frontend**: unchanged (browser-side RUM OTEL is a Stage 8+ concern)
- **`/metrics` endpoint**: now returns Prometheus exposition format (`# HELP` / `# TYPE` lines, real counter values) instead of placeholder JSON

---

### Stage 7 (Orbital Maneuvering)

**Location:** `stages/stage7/`

**k8s manifest changes:**
- HPA for search service (CPU-based, min 2 max 10 replicas)
- VPA for search service
- Redis Deployment becomes StatefulSet with PVC

**Code changes vs stage6:**
- Search Service: Redis caching (key: `search:{origin}:{destination}:{date}`, TTL 5min)
- `X-Cache: HIT/MISS` header on search responses
- All Go services: graceful shutdown fully implemented

---

### Stage 8 (Command Module)

**Location:** `stages/stage8/`

**k8s manifest changes:**
- RBAC: viewer role for passengers, admin role for flight management
- SecurityContext on all pods: `runAsNonRoot`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`
- OPA Gatekeeper policies for pod security standards
- Vault integration for secret management
- NetworkPolicies tightened further

**Code changes vs stage7:**
- Non-root user in all Dockerfiles
- Service account annotations on pods
- Trace context propagation fully wired

---

### Stage EKS (Cloud Target — EKS)

**Location:** `stages/eks/`

**New files:**
- `terraform/network/` — `terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws`, `10.0.0.0/16`, 2 public + 2 private subnets, 1 NAT in AZ-0 (saves $33/mo)
- `terraform/cluster/eks.tf` — `terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws` v21.x, k8s 1.31, encryption-at-rest with KMS, access entries replace aws-auth ConfigMap
- `terraform/cluster/node-groups.tf` — 2 × t3.small spot across 2 AZs, AL2023 AMI
- `terraform/cluster/addons.tf` — 6 EKS managed addons: vpc-cni, coredns, kube-proxy, eks-pod-identity-agent, aws-ebs-csi-driver, aws-load-balancer-controller
- `terraform/cluster/pod-identity.tf` — 4 IAM roles + EKS Pod Identity associations (EBS CSI, LBC, VPC CNI, Pod Identity agent)
- `terraform/cluster/policies/lbc-policy.json` — vendored LBC IAM policy from `kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller`
- `terraform/cluster/kms.tf` — KMS key for EKS secrets encryption
- `terraform/storage/storageclass.tf` — `ebs-gp3` StorageClass (default, `WaitForFirstConsumer`)
- `terraform/gateway/envoy-gateway.tf` — LBC Helm release + 11 `kubectl_manifest` applies for the Stage 2 set 5 Envoy Gateway stack
- `terraform/gateway/envoyproxy.yaml.tftpl` — the **only** Apollo11 k8s manifest that's different from Stage 2 set 5: 5 LBC annotations on the EnvoyProxy so the LBC materialises an NLB instead of relying on MetalLB
- `terraform/gateway/{envoy-gateway-install,gatewayclass,gateway,reference-grant,httproute-*}.yaml` — verbatim copies of the Stage 2 set 5 manifests
- `terraform/ecr.tf` — 6 ECR repos (one per service), MUTABLE tags, scan-on-push, lifecycle policy (keep last 10)
- `scripts/up.sh` — terraform init + apply + kubeconfig + wait-for-NLB-active
- `scripts/apply-workloads.sh` — Stage 3 apply.sh ported for EKS (ECR push instead of kind load; MetalLB and gateway install steps skipped)
- `scripts/down.sh` — ordered teardown (namespaces → Envoy stack → LBC Helm → terraform destroy → ECR purge → EBS sweep → ENI sweep)
- `scripts/verify.sh` — ~40 checks across 5 groups (cluster+addons, StatefulSets+PVCs+EBS PVs, deployments, NLB+Envoy, end-to-end + PVC persistence demo)
- `scripts/ebs-sweep.sh` — delete orphaned EBS volumes left over from interrupted destroys

**Status:** Stage EKS defines the EKS deployment shape for Stage 2 set 5 + Stage 3. The TF and scripts were not yet applied to a real AWS account from this build environment; structural correctness was verified by reading the Stage 2 set 5 and Stage 3 scripts/manifests to preserve apply/teardown ordering verbatim.

**Key design choices:**

1. **Single NAT in AZ-0 only.** Saves ~$33/mo vs 2 NATs. AZ-1 nodes pay cross-AZ data transfer on NAT-routed egress (~$0.01/GB; cents for dev). Toggle via `single_nat_gateway = true` (default) / `false`.
2. **EKS Pod Identity, not IRSA.** Newer, simpler, AWS-recommended. The eks_aws module's `service_account_role_arn` field is wired to Pod Identity roles.
3. **NLB scheme toggleable.** `nlb_scheme = "internet-facing"` (default, public DNS) or `"internal"` (saves $7.20/mo public IPv4 fees, needs VPN/bastion).
4. **`nlb-ip-target-type: ip`** so the NLB routes to pod IPs directly (requires VPC CNI in ip mode, the EKS default). Saves the NodePort hop.
5. **`deletion_protection = false`** so `terraform destroy` works in one shot. Flip to `true` for prod.
6. **State backend is local.** ~5-10MB state file. Documented swap path to S3 + DynamoDB for shared dev.
7. **`aws-auth` ConfigMap replaced by access entries.** Modern path on EKS 1.30+. The single admin principal gets `cluster-admin` policy via access entries.
8. **No MetalLB install.** The LBC + NLB replaces it. Stage 2 set 5's MetalLB manifest was deliberately NOT copied.
9. **Frontend images built and pushed to ECR.** `apply-workloads.sh` rewrites `apollo11/*:latest` → `<ECR_REGISTRY>/apollo11-dev/*:latest` on the fly via `sed`, then `kubectl apply -f` with the rewritten manifests.
10. **Frontend VITE_* URLs use `nip.io` by default** so the user doesn't have to edit `/etc/hosts` to hit the cluster. Override with `FRONTEND_HOST_SUFFIX=.apollo.local` if you want the canonical Apollo Airlines URL pattern.

**What this stage does NOT do:**

- No GKE module (Stage 9 covers GKE).
- No production HA (single NAT, no multi-region, no cluster autoscaler, no PodDisruptionBudgets).
- No Stage 4 probes + resource limits — the manifests in `stages/stage4/` are layered on top of Stage 3, not EKS. To add them on EKS, copy the probe paths from Stage 4 manifests into the apply-workloads.sh image-rewrite step.
- No observability stack (Stage 6 covers Prometheus + Grafana + OTEL).
- No service mesh (Stage 10 covers Linkerd).

**The Stage 2 set 5 manifests are reused verbatim; the only changes are 5 LBC annotations on the `EnvoyProxy` + the `ebs-gp3` StorageClass.**

---

### Stage 9 (Lunar Orbit)

**Location:** `stages/stage9/`

**New files:**
- `terraform/` — main.tf with EKS + GKE modules
- `terraform/modules/eks/` — cluster, node groups
- `terraform/modules/gke/` — cluster, node pools
- `terraform/modules/vpc/` — VPC, subnets
- `terraform/modules/ingress/` — ALB/NLB + Ingress
- `scripts/deploy.sh` — apply terraform, deploy k8s manifests

**Code changes vs stage8:** None (cloud provisioning only)

---

### Stage 10 (Mission Extensions)

**Location:** `stages/stage10/`

**k8s manifest changes:**
- Linkerd service mesh install + pod annotations
- Argo Rollouts for booking and search services
- Canary deployment strategy for search service
- Chaos Mesh for fault injection on booking service
- Velero for backup/restore

**Code changes vs stage9:** None (service mesh + progressive delivery)

---

### Stage 11 (Towards Mars)

**Location:** `stages/stage11/`

**New files:**
- Custom K8s operator for flight status management (Go)
- KEDA scaledobject for booking service (event-driven scaling based on booking rate)
- k3s homelab setup guide
- Backstage integration

**Code changes vs stage10:**
- Custom operator for flight status CRD
- KEDA scaler trigger configured
- Graceful shutdown fully implemented across all services

---

## Code Evolution Per Stage

| Stage | Code additions |
|---|---|
| launchpad | Base stubs — all services return hardcoded JSON. `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics` implemented. Structured logging with trace_id/span_id fields. X-Request-ID propagation. CORS middleware on all Go services. `addSSLMode()` helper for PostgreSQL connections (`?sslmode=disable`). `initDB()` uses `context.WithTimeout(15s)` + `PingContext` + error logging (no more infinite retry loops). `sql.NullString` for nullable DB columns. **Frontend upgraded to React/Tailwind CSS** (modern airline UI, VITE env vars for API URLs, multi-stage Docker build). Admin panel pages (Dashboard, Flights CRUD, Bookings view). |
| stage1 | (no code change — k8s deployment layer only) |
| stage2 | (no code change — networking layer only) |
| stage3 | (no code change — storage layer only) |
| stage4 | All 5 Go services (flight, booking, search, notification) and the FastAPI identity service expose 3 distinct probe endpoints: `/healthz/startup` (returns 200 once the HTTP server is up), `/healthz/live` (returns 200 unconditionally), `/healthz/ready` (returns 200 if the dependency is reachable, 503 otherwise). Legacy `/healthz` and `/readyz` kept returning 200 for back-compat. Graceful SIGTERM shutdown: Go services use `signal.Notify(quit, syscall.SIGTERM)` + `srv.Shutdown(ctx)` (30s timeout) + `db.Close()`. Python/identity registers a prior SIGTERM handler that logs and lets uvicorn's built-in drain (`timeout_graceful_shutdown=30`). Frontend NGINX config (`nginx.conf`) adds three `location = /healthz/*` blocks returning 200 unconditionally — readiness on the frontend is a kubelet-level check, not a downstream check. |
| stage5 | (no code change — packaging layer only) |
| stage6 | Full `/metrics` endpoint with all required Prometheus metrics. OTEL SDK integrated (traces + metrics). `trace_id` and `span_id` fields already present in logs since launchpad — now propagated through all calls. |
| stage7 | Search Service: Redis caching (key: `search:{origin}:{destination}:{date}`, TTL 5min). `X-Cache: HIT/MISS` header on search responses. All Go services: graceful shutdown fully implemented. |
| stage8 | Non-root user in all Dockerfiles. Service account annotations. Trace context propagation fully wired. |
| stage9 | (no code change — cloud provisioning layer only) |
| stage10 | (no code change — service mesh + progressive delivery only) |
| stage11 | Flight status CRD operator. KEDA scaler trigger configured. Graceful shutdown fully implemented across all services. |

---

## Key Constraints / Conventions

- **Devbox** for environment management — no manual `apt install` for k8s tools
- **Dockerfiles** use multi-stage builds and live in each service's directory
- **Go services:** `golang:1.22-alpine` — flight, booking, search, notification
- **Python service:** `python:3.12-slim` — identity
- **Frontend:** `node:20-alpine` for build, `nginx:alpine` for serving
- **PostgreSQL:** `postgres:15-alpine`
- **Redis:** `redis:7-alpine`
- **YAML frontmatter** on all documentation/readme files
- **Do NOT auto-git-commit** — write files locally, commit only when user explicitly asks
- **No npm on host** — frontend builds happen inside Docker (multi-stage: node builds → nginx serves)
- **User prefers:** concise responses, ASCII diagrams for architecture, comparison tables

---

## Devbox Tools

Currently in devbox.json: docker, k3d, kubectl, helm, skaffold, k9s, terraform, argocd

Needed but missing: kind, kustomize, k6, trivy, opa, kyverno, prometheus, grafana, linkerd, velero, cert-manager, vault, sealed-secrets, loki, otel-collector

---

## Stage Completion Status

| Phase | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Launchpad | ✅ Complete | React/Tailwind frontend, Docker Compose, 10 components |

## Observability Trace Design (Stage 6+)

The trace for a Create Booking request:

```text
Booking Service (root span)
    │
    ├── Identity Service: GET /api/users/{id}
    │
    ├── Flight Service: GET /api/flights/{id}
    │
    ├── Flight Service: PATCH /api/flights/{id}/seats
    │
    ├── Booking DB: INSERT bookings
    │
    └── Notification Service: POST /api/notify
```

Total spans: 6 spans across 3 services + 1 DB span.

This single trace demonstrates:
- Cross-service context propagation
- Database query timing
- Downstream dependency latency
- Failure points for fault injection (Stage 10)

---

## Booking Service — Flagship Workflow

The Booking Service is the primary vehicle for teaching distributed systems concepts:
- Stage 1-3: Deploy and observe basic health
- Stage 4: Reliable restarts with probes
- Stage 6: OTEL tracing across service boundaries
- Stage 7: Redis caching on search (downstream of booking workflow)
- Stage 9: Load testing with k6
- Stage 10: Chaos injection + service mesh fault injection

---

## Kubernetes Namespace Structure

| Namespace | Contents | Stages |
|---|---|---|
| apollo-airlines | All 10 components in a single namespace | Stage 1, Launchpad (compose) |
| apollo-airlines-apps | identity, flight, booking, search, notification + all DBs/redis + init jobs | Stage 2+ |
| apollo-airlines-ui | frontend | Stage 2+ |

Note: Stage 2 collapsed the originally-planned 3-namespace layout
(`infra`/`apps`/`ui`) down to 2 (`apps`/`ui`) — see Stage 2 details above.
